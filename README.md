# barista
Barista is a relatively simple Model/View/PubSub framework to generate "Views" using "Models", inside "Containers". Multiple "Views" can be subscribed to one "Model" and will re-render when the "Model" is explicitly published. "Views" can also be explicitly published by other "Views" to be re-rendered.
